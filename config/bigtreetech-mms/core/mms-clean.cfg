# If not enable, tray purge & brush wipe would be passed.
# Default is 1, enable.

# Speed settings in mm/min
# Speed of the extruder during purgingã€‚
purge_speed: 600
# Speed of the brush wiping process.
wipe_speed: 6000

# Retraction Compensation
# Reduces underextrusion after retraction
# The retract variable is used to pull back the filament 
# immediately after purging to prevent unwanted oozing.
# Some filaments are particularly prone to oozing and may continue 
# to drip from the nozzle for a second or two even after retraction.
# Speed in mm/min, distance in mm
retraction_compensation_speed: 10000
retraction_compensation_dist: 3

# Dwell time after purging and before cleaning to relieve nozzle pressure.
# Activating the fan and waiting for a few seconds 
# helps prevent blobs from sticking together.
fan_wait: 2 # seconds

# The number of wiping passes on the brush after purging.
# Increasing wipe_times can help remove excess filament from the nozzle tip.
# Adjust based on filament type and cleanliness requirements.
wipe_times: 3

# Extruder load distances for purging.
# The length of this list represents the number of iterations per blob.
# Typically, 4 iterations are sufficient for most purges.
# If needed, add more values to extend the purge process.
